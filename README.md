# Inverted-pendulum-control-using-kalman-filter
This project focuses on the simulation and control of an inverted pendulum system mounted on a cart using Python. The main objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of control strategies, both with and without a Kalman filter, in stabilizing the pendulum and maintaining its upright position.
